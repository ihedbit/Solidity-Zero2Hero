# SolidityZero2Hero ERC-1155 Token

SolidityZero2Hero is an ERC-1155 token implemented in Solidity. It is built on the OpenZeppelin library, utilizing various modules for enhanced functionality. This token supports the creation of fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single contract. The features include pausing, burning, and supply control, making it versatile for a variety of use cases.

## Features

1. **ERC-1155 Standard Compliance:** SolidityZero2Hero adheres to the ERC-1155 standard, enabling the creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single contract.

2. **Pausing:** The token contract can be paused and unpaused by the owner, providing additional control over token functionality.

3. **Burning:** Token holders can burn their tokens, reducing the total supply.

4. **Supply Control:** The contract supports supply control, allowing the owner to mint tokens with specific IDs and amounts.

5. **URI Management:** The contract provides a function to set the base URI, allowing for the dynamic association of metadata with tokens.

## Getting Started

To use SolidityZero2Hero in your project, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable
```

2. Deploy the contract, ensuring to initialize it with the desired initial owner.

3. Interact with the contract using standard ERC-1155 methods, as well as the additional features provided.

## Usage

### Contract Initialization

Initialize the contract by providing the initial owner's address:

```solidity
function initialize(address initialOwner) initializer public {
    // Contract initialization logic
}
```

### Pausing and Unpausing

The owner can pause and unpause the contract:

```solidity
function pause() public onlyOwner {
    // Pause logic
}

function unpause() public onlyOwner {
    // Unpause logic
}
```

### Minting

The owner can mint new tokens:

```solidity
function mint(address account, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes memory data) public onlyOwner {
    // Minting logic
}
```

### Minting Batch

The owner can mint a batch of tokens:

```solidity
function mintBatch(address to, uint256[] memory ids, uint256[] memory amounts, bytes memory data) public onlyOwner {
    // Minting batch logic
}
```

### URI Management

The owner can set the base URI for metadata:

```solidity
function setURI(string memory newuri) public onlyOwner {
    // Set URI logic
}
```

### Burning

Token holders can burn their tokens:

```solidity
// Burning logic
```
