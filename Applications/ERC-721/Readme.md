# SolidityZero2Hero ERC-721 Token

SolidityZero2Hero is an ERC-721 token implemented in Solidity. It is built on the OpenZeppelin library, utilizing various modules for enhanced functionality. This token includes features such as enumerable tokens, URI storage, pausing, access control, burning, voting capabilities, and upgradeability.

## Features

1. **ERC-721 Standard Compliance:** SolidityZero2Hero adheres to the ERC-721 standard, ensuring compatibility with various decentralized applications and platforms.

2. **Enumerable Tokens:** The token supports enumeration, allowing for the efficient retrieval of token lists.

3. **URI Storage:** The contract supports storage of URIs for each token, enabling the association of metadata with individual tokens.

4. **Pausing:** The token contract can be paused and unpaused by a designated pauser, providing additional control over token functionality.

5. **Access Control:** Roles are assigned to administrators, pausers, minters, and upgraders to control specific functionalities and permissions.

6. **Burning:** Token holders can burn their tokens, reducing the total supply.

7. **Voting Capabilities:** The token incorporates voting functionality, enabling token holders to participate in governance decisions.

8. **Upgradeability:** The contract is upgradeable, allowing for future enhancements or bug fixes without disrupting existing functionalities.

## Getting Started

To use SolidityZero2Hero in your project, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable
```

2. Deploy the contract, ensuring to initialize it with the desired administrators, pausers, minters, and upgraders.

3. Interact with the contract using standard ERC-721 methods, as well as the additional features provided.

## Usage

### Contract Initialization

Initialize the contract by providing the default admin, pauser, minter, and upgrader addresses:

```solidity
function initialize(address defaultAdmin, address pauser, address minter, address upgrader) initializer public {
    // Contract initialization logic
}
```

### Pausing and Unpausing

The designated pauser can pause and unpause the contract:

```solidity
function pause() public onlyRole(PAUSER_ROLE) {
    // Pause logic
}

function unpause() public onlyRole(PAUSER_ROLE) {
    // Unpause logic
}
```

### Minting

The designated minter can safely mint new tokens with associated URIs:

```solidity
function safeMint(address to, string memory uri) public onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {
    // Minting logic
}
```

### Burning

Token holders can burn their tokens:

```solidity
function burn(uint256 tokenId) public {
    // Burning logic
}
```

### Voting

Token holders can participate in governance decisions:

```solidity
// Voting-related functions
```

### Upgradeability

The contract is upgradeable, allowing for future enhancements:

```solidity
// Upgradeability logic
```
