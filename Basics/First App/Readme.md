# Solidity Hello World

## Overview

In the context of smart contracts, the term "app" typically refers to decentralized applications, commonly known as "DApps." A decentralized application is a software application that runs on a decentralized network, such as a blockchain. Smart contracts, written in languages like Solidity for Ethereum, are often a fundamental component of DApps.

## Smart Contract

The provided Solidity code defines a simple smart contract named "Counter" on the Ethereum blockchain. The purpose of this contract is to maintain and manipulate a numerical counter. It includes three main functions: get(), inc(), and dec().


# Deployment

To deploy the smart contract, you'll need a development environment with a Solidity compiler and a tool like Remix or Truffle. Make sure your compiler version is greater than or equal to 0.8.13 and less than 0.9.0.
