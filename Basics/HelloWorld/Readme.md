# Solidity Hello World

## Overview

This repository contains a basic Solidity smart contract that prints "Hello World!" on the Ethereum blockchain. It serves as a simple introduction to writing and deploying smart contracts using Solidity.

## Smart Contract

The smart contract is named `HelloWorld.sol` . It's a straightforward contract with a single string variable `greet` that holds the greeting message.


# Deployment

To deploy the smart contract, you'll need a development environment with a Solidity compiler and a tool like Remix or Truffle. Make sure your compiler version is greater than or equal to 0.8.13 and less than 0.9.0.
