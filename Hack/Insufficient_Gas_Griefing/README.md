## Insufficient Gas Griefing Vulnerability

### Description

This Solidity smart contract example illustrates the "Insufficient Gas Griefing" vulnerability, a type of attack that exploits the lack of gas stipend in certain operations. The attack involves an attacker deliberately sending a transaction with insufficient gas, causing a state-changing function to revert while consuming gas fees. This results in wasted gas for the sender without any lasting effect on the blockchain.
Vulnerable Contract
InsufficientGasGriefing.sol

The vulnerable contract has two main functions:

    deposit()
        Allows users to deposit Ether into their balance.

    withdraw(uint256 amount)
        Attempts to simulate some computation or state change using a loop.
        Lacks a gas stipend in the loop, making it vulnerable to insufficient gas attacks.
        The loop runs out of gas, causing a revert of state changes but consuming gas fees.

Usage

    Deploy the contract to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.
    Interact with the contract by depositing Ether and attempting withdrawals.

Example:

solidity

// Deploy the contract
const contract = await InsufficientGasGriefing.deployed();

// Deposit Ether
await contract.deposit({ value: web3.utils.toWei('1', 'ether') });

// Attempt a withdrawal with insufficient gas
await contract.withdraw(1, { gas: 50000 });

### Mitigation

To mitigate the "Insufficient Gas Griefing" vulnerability, developers should be cautious with gas consumption in loops and state-changing operations. Ensure that gas costs are properly managed, and critical state changes are performed outside loops to prevent griefing attacks.

### Disclaimer

This example is for educational purposes only. Developers should carefully review and test their smart contracts to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. Use best practices, security audits, and testing frameworks to enhance the security of your contracts.
