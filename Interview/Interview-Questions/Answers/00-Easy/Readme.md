# Solidity Easy Questions Answers

1. What is the difference between private, internal, public, and external functions?

In Solidity, functions can have different visibility levels, which determine how they can be accessed and by whom. Here's an overview of the main visibility specifiers:

1. **Private Functions:**

   - **Scope:** Accessible only within the contract that defines them.
   - **Use Case:** Typically used for helper functions or internal logic that should not be exposed outside the contract.

2. **Internal Functions:**

   - **Scope:** Accessible within the current contract and its derived contracts.
   - **Use Case:** Suitable for functions that need to be accessed internally, within the contract hierarchy.

3. **Public Functions:**

   - **Scope:** Accessible from anywhere, both within the contract and externally.
   - **Use Case:** Commonly used for functions that need to be accessed externally, serving as an interface to interact with the contract.

4. **External Functions:**

   - **Scope:** Similar to public functions, but external functions cannot be called internally. They are intended for external contract-to-contract communication.
   - **Use Case:** Ideal for functions that need to be called from outside the contract, often used in interaction with other contracts on the blockchain.

In summary, the choice of visibility specifier depends on the intended use of the function and the desired level of access control. Private functions are for internal use only, internal functions are for within the contract and its derived contracts, public functions are accessible from anywhere, and external functions are specifically designed for external contract interactions.
